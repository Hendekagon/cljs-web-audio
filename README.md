# clj-web-audio

An extremely rough Clojurescript interface to the Web Audio API

The aim of this library is to provide some nice abstractions for
sonification of data, not for playing or generating music

## Usage

`use 'cljs-web-audio.repl`
`(cljs-build)`

Then visit ./public/index.html

The examples code is in /examples/test.cljs

It's a mess...this is a weekend project I hardly ever looked at
