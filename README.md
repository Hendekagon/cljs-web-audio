# clj-web-audio

An extremely rough Clojurescript interface to the Web Audio API.

The aim of this library is to provide some nice abstractions for
sonification of data, not for playing or generating music.
It is far from that.


## Usage

Use

$ lein cljbuild once

to compile, then call it from your webpage as in the examples given in ./public

or, use a repl - if you know Clojurescript you'll know what to do.

It's so rough it's barely usable, but see tests.cljs, which are my experiments.
