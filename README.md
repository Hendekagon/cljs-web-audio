# clj-web-audio

An extremely rough Clojurescript interface to the Web Audio API.

The aim of this library is (was) to provide some nice abstractions for
sonification of data, *not* for playing or generating music.

I've pretty much given-up on this though, because:

a) I don't know enough about audio to do this right (esp WRT timing)



## Usage

It's so rough it's barely usable, but see tests.
